'''
Prepare the Data:

Ensure your dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Check for any missing values in the variables of interest (e.g., median income and book prices).
Define the Model:

Choose a dependent variable (e.g., book prices or sales data if available).
Choose independent variables (e.g., median income, number of households).
Split the Data:

Divide your data into a training set and a testing set. A common split is 80% training and 20% testing.
Train the Model:

Use a linear regression model from a library like scikit-learn.
Evaluate the Model:

Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics like R-squared, mean squared error, etc.
Interpret the Results:

Analyze the regression coefficients to understand the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
