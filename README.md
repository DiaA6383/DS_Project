# Neighborhood Niche: Target Market Analysis for Personalized Children's Books

## Project Overview
Neighborhood Niche is a data-driven initiative to identify lucrative markets for a startup focused on personalized children's books in New York City. Our objective is to create a Market Potential Index (MPI) that highlights neighborhoods with a high concentration of our target demographic: families with disposable income and children under 18.

## Data Analysis Pipeline

Our project follows a structured data analysis approach to ensure comprehensive and accurate insights:

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
- Secure access to relevant datasets.
- Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

### Step 2: Variable Isolation
- Conduct exploratory data analysis by plotting each variable in isolation.
- Examine relationships between key variables and geographical markers (e.g., population vs. ZIP code, income vs. ZIP code).

### Step 3: Aggregate Metrics
- Compare aggregate metrics against expected distributions to validate data quality.
- Investigate and contextualize outliers (e.g., an affluent family in a typically low-income ZIP code).

### Step 4: SIR Modeling by ZIP Code
- Implement SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) models for each ZIP code to understand the potential market spread of our product.

### Step 5: Synthesis of SIR Models
- Combine individual SIR models to create a comprehensive picture of market dynamics.
- Use synthesized data to inform marketing strategies and business decisions.

Each step in this pipeline is critical for painting an accurate picture of our potential market and for strategizing our business approach accordingly.
