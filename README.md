# Target Market Analysis for Children's Book E-Commerce

## Project Overview
We are building a strategic marketing plan for a children's book e-commerce platform. The core objective is to identify which ZIP codes present the most significant opportunities based on socio-economic and demographic factors.

## Research Question
- Which ZIP codes are most likely to yield the highest engagement and sales for children's books sold online?

## Data Analysis Pipeline

### Data Acquisition
- Secure data on household income, family composition, and literacy rates within ZIP codes.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conduct a deep dive into the data, examining each variable to understand the distribution within and across ZIP codes.

### Data Validation
- Ensure the reliability of our data by comparing it to known benchmarks and explaining any discrepancies.

### Market Potential Index (MPI) Creation
- Craft an MPI to score and rank ZIP codes, focusing on variables like average income, number of children, and bookstore proximity.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Acquire Data
- Collect data from credible sources to form a robust dataset for analysis.

### Step 2: Individual Variable Analysis
- Analyze key variables in isolation (e.g., population vs. ZIP, income vs. ZIP).

### Step 3: Data Quality Check
- Validate the data by comparing it to expected distributions and rationalizing outliers.

### Step 4: Market Potential Analysis
- Use the MPI to evaluate and rank each ZIP code according to our target market criteria.

## Future Plans
- Integrate an SIR model to simulate market penetration and customer lifecycle in the future phases of our project.
