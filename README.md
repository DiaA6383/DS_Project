# Data Science Project for 'Big Orange Cow'

## Overview
This Data Science project is developed to pinpoint optimal market areas in NYC for 'Big Orange Cow'â€”a start-up venturing into personalized children's books. Using data analytics and predictive modeling, we aim to identify neighborhoods with the highest potential for product acceptance and market penetration.

## Objective
Our goal is to analyze NYC-specific open data to locate neighborhoods that promise the highest customer engagement and market exposure for children's books, considering factors such as income, population, and retail space costs.

## Significance
This project is a confluence of data science with real-world business application, demonstrating the power of data in strategic decision-making. It holds personal significance as it directly impacts the growth strategy of 'Big Orange Cow', while showcasing a practical application of the data science skills I have honed.

## Uniqueness
The project stands out by employing epidemiological models to predict market exposure and combining traditional demographic analysis with innovative data sources like social media sentiment and retail space economics.

## Data Sources
- Proprietary income data by zip code provided by 'Big Orange Cow'.
- NYC Open Data for demographic and population metrics.
- Epidemiological models adapted to simulate marketing exposure.
- Yelp data for identifying children-related business locations.
- Retail space cost data for assessing economic viability.
